					<p>A set of three print ads conceived and designed with the help of the wonderful copywriter <a href="http://www.behance.net/mollylees">Molly Lees</a>. Targeting a higher class of coffee drinkers, we gave the Bodum Bistro an elite, royal feeling. The series maintains a consistent feel while still having three unique images and simple, elegant copy on each.</p>

					<p>As the designer of Black Ties & Tennis Shoes—a student-formed capstone agency—we planned and presented a full strategic campaign to a local startup, Genesis Internships. Having primarily a web-presence, we focused on providing fresh designs for their website (including a mobile version) and social media sites while upholding their brand standards. Other executions included a print campaign, a few guerrilla tactics, and a small meet-and-greet event.</p>

					<p>These three, 2-foot by 7-foot panels were mocked-up for the HR department at InteliSpend Prepaid Solutions. The creative services department was given the task of providing HR with an area to promote wellness, community, and green initiatives to employees at their St. Louis headquarters. Each panel would be constructed with a metal backing to allow for flyers and posters to be hung via magnets. Using the brand’s color palette, this design was meant to be playful, inviting, and maintain a healthy, active feel.</p>

							<h3>Logo Design</h3>
						</hgroup>
					</header>
					
					<p>Created just for fun, but with hopes of starting something new, this logo was designed for my brother amidst his newfound love for bike polo. When he’s not actually playing, he can be found hand-milling mallet heads for him and his friends. I wanted to give his “brand” an older craftsman/medieval look to evoke times when people still made things by hand and weren’t mass-produced by machines.</p>
